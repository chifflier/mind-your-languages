## Language gotchas

---

### Javascript breaks transitivity

```javascript
document.write("'0'",'0'==0?"==":"<>","0 and ");
document.write("0",0=='0.0'?"==":"<>","'0.0' and ");
document.write("'0'",'0'=='0.0'?"==":"<>","'0.0'<br />");
```

Expected result: `'0'==0 and 0=='0.0' and '0'=='0.0'`

Result: `'0'==0 and 0=='0.0' and '0'<>'0.0'`

Reason: Strings can be casted to integers, except if compared to another string

### Parsing integers

The `parseInt` function seems to quite innovative:

```javascript
parseInt('2',10)
2
parseInt('null',10)
NaN
parseInt('null',23)
NaN
parseInt('null',24)
23
parseInt('infinity',20)
18
parseInt('infinity',28)
324267766
```

Expected result: `NaN`

Reason: ???

Theory:
In base 24, 0-9 are the first 10 digits. Then come the letters. And since "n" is the 14th letter, it has a value in base 24
Since "n" can be interpreted, it moves on to the next letter: "u". But "u" doesn't have a value in base 24, since there are only 24 digits!
So, the parseInt function just returns the integer value for what "n" represents in base 24 â†’ 23.

This would work for the 'null' string, but has no explanation for the `null` object:
```javascript
parseInt(null,24)
23
```

Also, this seems to stop working at base 37:
```javascript
parseInt("null",36)
1112745
parseInt("null",37)
NaN
```

See https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-parseint-string-radix for the definition of `parseint`.
