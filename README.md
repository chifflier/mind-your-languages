# Mind your languages

This collection of examples follows a [paper from the LangSec14
Workshop](http://spw14.langsec.org/papers/MindYourLanguages.pdf), discussing
the question of the intrinsic security characteristics of programming languages.
Through illustrations and discussions, it
advocates for a different vision of well-known mechanisms and is
intended to provide some food for thoughts regarding languages
and development tools, as well as recommendations regarding the
education of developers or evaluators for secure software.
